# User Guide Overview


Forecaster is a powerful demand forecasting tool that helps you quickly produce accurate data-driven forecasts.

This User Guide has 3 main sections: this Quick Start section, a Reference section, a How To section. 

1.  This Quick Start section starts with a quick tutorial on how to set up a very basic model in Forecaster. Subsequent sections give a brief overview of the main Forecaster functionality. 

2. The Reference section provides detailed information on all Forecaster functionality, with a structure reflecting that of Forecaster itself.

3. The How To section on the other hand is written around specific topics, such as how to choose the best forecast model, or how to deal with interval data.
