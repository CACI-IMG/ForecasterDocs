# External Processes

This sections gives details of all Forecaster's External Processes. External Processes are typically used for exporting data from Forecaster, or producing diagnostics or reports. Forecaster ships with 3 standard script out of the box (as described below). However, additional scripts can be created by CACI for customised operations such as exporting in specific formats, producing reports, or pushing data to databases. Feel free to contact CACI if you're spending too much time manually exporting or combining data from Forecaster - a custom External Process may well be the best way of automating that process.  External Processes can also be created by any users familiar with the R environment.
The *Export Data* script provides flexible data exportation, while the other scripts are more aimed at providing diagnostic and lower level information.

- [**Export Data**](Export-Data.md): For flexible data exportation to Excel or flat file
- [**R Diagnostics**](R-Diagnostics.md): For diagnostic information on the R installation
- [**Export Project Data**](Export-Project-Data.md): For exporting low level project and diagnostic data
