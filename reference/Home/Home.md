The first tab on the Forecaster ribbon is the Home tab.  This tab lets you create and manipulate Solutions and Projects, manage application settings, as well as providing help. The Home ribbon breaks down into 3 groups:


- **Solution:** For creating and managing solutions and projects
{% page-ref page="Home-Solution.md" %}

- **Tools:** For managing global settings, including scripts and proxy settings
{% page-ref page="Home-Tools.md" %}

- **Help:** For help, including filing error reports and version information
{% page-ref page="Home-Help.md" %}
