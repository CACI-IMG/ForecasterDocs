# Reference

This reference section gives detailed information on all aspects of Forecaster. Is is laid out in the same manner as Forecaster itself, with each section here corresponding to a tab within Forecaster. Forecaster is based around 5 main ribbon tabs, across the top of the screen. Generally the operation goes from left to right, following the order of these tabs. 


You typically would create a new solution in the Home tab...
{% page-ref page="/reference/Home/Home.md" %}

...then import data in the Data tab...
{% page-ref page="./Data/Data.md" %}

... build and manage models and forecasts in the Model tab...
{% page-ref page="/Forecasting/Forecasting-Overview.md" %}

... view the forecasts in the Analysis tab...
{% page-ref page="./Analysis/Analysis.md" %}

... automate the whole process if needed in the Automation tab.
{% page-ref page="reference/Automation/Automation.md" %}
