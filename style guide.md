# Style Guide for Forecaster User Guide (CACI Internal)


* **Button Name** bold style used for referring to buttons (called buttons, not icons)
* *Data Tab* italic style used for tabs, filenames, script names (try and avoid quotes)
* Third person used throughout ('you' not 'we' or 'the user')
* Reasonably conversational style (avoid e.g. 'depicted', 'desire'. 'prior to')
* Stick to "training range" and "forecast range" for consistency (Avoid recall or validation)
* Use "Range" not "Set" (so forecast range not validation set)
* Column v field: Forecaster uses a mix, column in most places, but field in the formula editor. Best to stick to "column", and the formula editor should probably be updated to match
* Use 2 spaces after a full stop
