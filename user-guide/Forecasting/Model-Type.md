# Model Type

The CACI Forecaster allows the user to create two different types of forecast:

-	Simple model: Enables the user to apply one forecast method at a time to the data
-	Decomposition model: A combined model, allowing the user to perform two different forecasting methods on different parts of the data.  One particular use for this is to split your data into trend and seasonal components, enabling you to use a different forecasting method on each component before re-combining the two to form the final forecast

<!-- A separate document describing decomposition models can be obtained by CACI [1]. -->
