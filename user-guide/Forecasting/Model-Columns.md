# Model Columns
This part of the Model ribbon  on defining or removing a columnâ€™s type, as described in the following sections.


### Column Types
Two types of column specification are possible in the CACI Forecaster: 
-	**Input**:  Column is used as an input to the forecast model (provided inputs are permitted in the forecast model)
-	**Target**:  Column to be forecasted (only one can be selected)
To assign a column to a given column type, select the column name or range of columns of interest.  Multiple columns can be selected using the `shift` key. The columns will turn blue is selected.  At this point press one of the column types: Input or Target.  
Once complete, the column background colour will change to reflect the colours of the column type: inputs are yellow whilst the target column is green.  The data grid should then appear similar to that shown in Figure 35.

### Exclude a Column
To deselect a data column from any specific model, select its name with the mouse pointer and then press the exclude column icon to remove it from the model.  The model type will be removed and the background colour of the column will be returned to white.
