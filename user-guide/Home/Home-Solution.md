# Home Tab - Solution Section
The *Solution* section of the main Home tab lets you create and manage solutions and projects.  A solution is a workspace that can hold any number of forecast projects. A project holds data, a forecasting model, as well as the forecasts themselves.


The first part of the *Solution* section lets you create, save, open and close solutions. These are all the standard operations that you'd expect when creating, for example, a Word or Excel document. 

The second part of the Solution group focusses on managing projects within the solution, and is covered in more detail in the following sections.

## Managing Solutions

The **New Solution** button (or quick keys `Ctrl+N`) is used to create a new forecast solution. This is a workspace that can hold any number of forecast projects. When a new solution is created, it is given a name, and saved into a specific folder.

Once these parameters have been specified and the **OK** button is clicked, the new solution is created.  This solution is a folder with a number of files (*.fsol for the solution itself, and *.fmp for individual projects within the solution).
 
The solution **Open**, **Close** and **Save** buttons are pretty standard, and work as you'd expect to open, close, and save the solution.

* To open a solution, click on the **Open** button (or quick keys `Ctrl+O`), select a Forecaster solution file (named *.fsol) and select OK.  
* To close a solution, click on the **Close** button.  If the solution has been changed since the last save, you'll be asked if you'd like to save those changes
* To save a *project*, click the **Save** button.  This will save only the current active project (the one selected in the Solution Explorer to the left of the screen). 
* To save the *solution*, click the **Save Solution** button.  This will then bring up two save options:
    * Save:  Saves the whole solution. Quick keys `Ctrl+Shift+S` do the same thing
    * Save As: To save the solution under a new name or in a different location
 

All these actions can also be found on the quick access toolbar, right at the top left of the Forecaster window.

## Recent solutions

Links to recent solutions can be found either using the **Recent Solutions** button, or in the main window when you have the *Home* tab selected.  

## Manually copying solutions
When a solution is saved, a solution directory is created and a number of files are placed in this directory.  If you'd like to move a forecast solution without using Save As, for example if you have multiple solutions to move, you can simply copy the whole solution folder to the new location.

## Deleting solutions
You can't delete a solution from within Forecaster, so the best way is to delete the solution folder using Windows Explorer (as you would for deleting a Word or Excel document - apart from the fact you're deleting a folder not a single file).
