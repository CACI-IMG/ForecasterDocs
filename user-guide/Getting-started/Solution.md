# Solution
While a project holds a single forecast, a solution represents a single workspace which may hold any number of individual projects.

## Solution Hierarchy

Once a new solution has been created or loaded, its structure can be seen in the Solution Explorer window (by default to the left of the screen).  A solution may contain one or more projects. The projects can be related to one another, such as projects with the same dataset but with differing forecasting models, or they can be completely unrelated but grouped in the solution for convenience. For example, all call volume forecasts in a particular contact centre could be grouped into one solution. The image below shows an example where projects for Motor, Home and Travel have been grouped in the same solution, together with a range of different forecasting techniques for Motor Sales.

In this example, you can see a number of sub-forecast projects within the Motor Sales forecast.  Grouping forecasts together like this makes it easier to manage solutions, which is particularly valuable when dealing with larger numbers of forecasts. It can often be really useful to keep forecasts from a number of models side by side, so you can compare the relative performance of different forecasting models.


## Solution Management

A number of management activities can be carried out on Forecaster Solutions - all under the *Home* tab. This section gives a quick overview of Solution operations - see [here](/user-guide/Home/Home-Solution.md) for more detail

### Creating a New Solution

The New Solution button (or quick keys `Ctrl+N`) is used to create a new forecast solution. A solution can contain any number of projects, each with their own data and forecasting models.

When creating a new solution, you're given the option to enter a solution name and also, if needed, change the location of the solution folder.

 Once these parameters have been specified, pressing the OK button creates the new solution. A new solution starts with a single empty project called *Project1*.

### Opening, Closing and Saving a Solution

A solution in Forecaster can be managed through the options available in the Home Tab.

*	To open a solution, click on the **Open** button, select the relevant solution file and select OK.  Alternatively press the `Ctrl+O` keys to access the same open solution dialog
*	To close a solution, click on the **Close** button.  If the solution has had some changes before the last save, then the application will ask you if you'd like to save these changes
*   To save a *project*, click on the **Save** button
*	To save a *solution*, click on the **Save Solution** button.  This will then display two save options:
    -	**Save**:  Saves the solution under the current name.  Files can be saved directly by pressing the `Ctrl+S` keys
    -	**Save As**: This lets you save the solution under a new name or in a different location

All of this functionality can also be reached from quick access toolbar in the top left of Forecaster.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a solution is saved, a solution folder is created and a number of files are placed in this folder. You can move a forecast solution without using Save As (for example if you have multiple solutions to move), by directly copying the whole folder to the new location.
{% endhint %}



### Deleting a Solution
You can't delete a solution from within Forecaster, so to delete a solution, delete the solution folder using the usual Windows Explorer route.


### Recent Solutions
Quick links to recent solutions are available via the Home â€“ Solution ribbon or in the main window in the Home tab.
