## Navigation Tabs
The application makes use of a ribbon tool bar and has been broken down into the following sections:



* [Home Tab](/user-guide/Home/Home.md) : This tab lets you manage the solution. This includes creating and managing both solutions and projects, as well as managing options and custom scripts.

* [Automation Tab](/user-guide/Automation/Automation.md) : This tab is for automating the forecasting process by creating workflows that can create a project, import the data, setup models, generate the forecasts and export the results.

There is a natural order to building the forecasts, generally speaking the forecasting process starts with the Home tab, moves to Data, then to the Model and Analysis, and finally onto the Automation for productionising the process.  This follows the order of the ribbon tabs from left to right. However, you can move around the application as you see fit, adapting forecasts and updating results.  


## [Solution Explorer](/user-guide/Getting-started/Solution.md)
The Solution Explorer window (generally to the left of the screen) shows details of all available projects within the solution and is visible in all tabs.
