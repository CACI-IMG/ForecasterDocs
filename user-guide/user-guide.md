# User Guide


Forecaster is a powerful demand forecasting tool that helps you quickly produce accurate data-driven forecasts.


This User Guide is formed of two main sections, the User Guide itself, and a Use Cases section. 

1. The User Guide provides detailed information on all Forecaster functionality, with a structure reflecting that of Forecaster itself. It starts with the 'Getting Started' section as a quick introduction to getting running with the tool, and subsequent sections cover the 5 main Forecaster tabs. 

2. The Use Cases section on the other hand is written around specific topics, such as how to choose the best forecast model, or how to deal with interval data.
