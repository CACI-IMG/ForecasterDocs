# Series Setup


The Forecaster allows the user to control which graphs are displayed on the plot. The setup is split into three groups, detailed in the following table.

You are only able to select one option here                                                                                              |

To display a forecast on the graph, select the tick box next to the project/snapshotâ€™s name. <br/><br/> Note that the forecasted fitted values will be available for both the training and validation sets, also allowing you to review how well the model performs on the training data set |
