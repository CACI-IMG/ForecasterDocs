# Automation

The last item on the application ribbon is the Automation tab. This tab gives the user the tools to automate the whole forecasting process by creating **workflows**. Workflows are used to create a project, import the data, setup models, generate the forecasts and export the results.

Workflows are used to automate common tasks such as creating a project, re-importation, model re-training, and data export. Workflows are far faster to run, and minimise the potential for error. With Workflows, multiple projects can be created at the same time.
