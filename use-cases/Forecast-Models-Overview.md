### Forecasting

Note that if the forecast model contains inputs, each input column needs to be populated with a forecast in order to provide a forecast for the target variable.

Progress on the forecast generation will be shown in the Output Window.  The performance of the forecast is now ready to be reviewed using the **Analysis** tab.


### Model Details

Once the forecast has been completed successfully, the user can see the model's details by clicking on the relevant button as in the image below.

Depending on the model, users can see additional insights about the forecast such as prediction accuracy and importance of each input variable.
