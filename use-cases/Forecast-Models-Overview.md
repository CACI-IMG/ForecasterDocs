### Forecasting

Once a forecast model is selected, clicking on the **Forecast** button in the *Data â€“ Forecasting* ribbon section trains the model and generates the forecasts.  This will populate the last two columns in the data grid: Forecast and Forecast Error.

Note that if the forecast model uses inputs, each input column needs to be populated with a forecast in order to provide a forecast for the target variable.

Progress on the forecast generation will be shown in the Output Window.  The performance of the forecast is now ready to be reviewed using the *Analysis* tab.
